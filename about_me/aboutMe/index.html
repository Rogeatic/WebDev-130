        <p>Hi everyone, my name is Logan Bell! I'm from 
            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/dqUNAkUE2nu4aky48">Folsom California</a>,
            and I like to wake surf and hike in my free time. My favorite passtimes 
            consist of: going to costco and snatching a cheap slice of pizza, video editing, 
            and gaming. This is my 3rd semester, I'm hoping to graduate with a 
            Computer science BS when I turn 20 in a couple of years. I love the 
            buildings at BYUI, they just seem well built. <br> 
            Hopefully I can find a better color scheme next time besides eye gouging blue and disgusting samon...
        </p>
